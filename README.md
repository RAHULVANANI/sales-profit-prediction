# sales-profit-prediction

📊 1. Data Understanding
Dataset: sales_data_10k.csv
Target Variable: Profit ($)

Features:
> Sales ($) – Revenue generated
> Category – Type of product
> egion – Geographic region
> Any other relevant features

⚡️ 2. Objectives
> Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover sales and profit trends.
> Build and evaluate 4 machine learning models to predict Profit ($).
> Compare model performances and select the best model based on evaluation metrics.

🧠 3. Machine Learning Models
> Linear Regression: Basic model assuming a linear relationship.
> Random Forest Regressor: Ensemble model to reduce overfitting.
> Gradient Boosting Regressor: Sequential model that improves weak learners.
> Decision Tree Regressor: Simple tree-based model that tends to overfit.

🎯 4. Model Evaluation Metrics
> Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
> R-squared (R²): Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the target. Closer to 1 is better.

📝 6. Future Improvements
> Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
> Add feature engineering to introduce more relevant features.
> Perform time-series analysis if time-based data is available.
